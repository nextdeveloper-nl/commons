# Domain Ownership Validation via DNS Record

## Reachability Validation:

- Initiate a connection attempt to the root domain (example.com).
- Utilize Whois to record query.
- If successful (e.g., receives response code 200), proceed to token generation.
- Handle timeouts, connection errors, and unreachable domains gracefully.
- Additionally, verify DNS server responsiveness and domain's nameserver configuration.

## Token Generation:

- Generate a unique, secure token of a suitable length (40 characters).
- Use a secure random number generator for enhanced security.
- This token is provided to the user.

## User Adds Token to DNS TXT Record:

- Provide clear instructions to the user on accessing their DNS management console. 
- Explain the steps for creating a new TXT record. 
- Specify the exact TXT record name (e.g., _acme-challenge.example.com for ACME protocol). 
- Emphasize the importance of accurate token value entry, including spaces or quotes if required. 
- Encourage the use of DNS record TTL (Time To Live) adjustments for faster validation propagation.

## User Initiates Validation:

- Offer a clear way for the user to trigger the validation process (button, link).
- Provide an estimated validation time, accounting for DNS propagation delays.
- Acknowledge that delays are not unusual and may vary depending on factors beyond your control.
- Consider implementing email notifications to inform users of validation completion.

## Code Checks DNS TXT Record for Token:

- Query the user's domain's TXT records using appropriate DNS lookup methods.
- Extract the TXT record values and search for an exact match with the provided token.
- Implement case-sensitive comparison as token values may be case-specific.
- Handle potential errors gracefully, providing informative messages to the user.

## Ownership Validation and Completion:

- If the token is found, confirm domain ownership to the user.
- Return a success code or status message.
- If the token is not found, provide clear error messages and allow for re-initiating the process.
